//FSAE-CAN-Translator Config File
//
//Format: MessageID,MessageLength,title,isSignedInt,isBigEndian,scalar,offset,units (continues on for more sub-messages)
//
//All values must be separated by commas.
//All values must be specified or else the program won't read the config file correctly.
//Booleans can be either 'false' or 'true', floats must have the format 'x.xxxxf'.
//Sub-Message titles cannot be less than or equal to 7 characters in length (Darab Limitation).
//Sub-Message units must be less than or equal to 4 characters in length (Darab Limitation).
//If the message length is X, then there must be X/2 sub-messages. For example, a message length of 4 will have 2, 8 will have 4, etc.
//Separate each message with a newline
//Comments must begin with a '//'
//If the config file is not properly read by the program, it will give an error and exit and you will need to double-check the formatting.
